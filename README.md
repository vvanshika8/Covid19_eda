# Mock Project- visualising covid19 trends and impacts for various regions
Covid19 EDA (Example: Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID-19 data)

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to understand the trends and patterns of the pandemic. Using publicly available datasets, it provides insights into the spread of the virus, total cases, deaths, and other key metrics. The project is designed to be a starting point for data analysis and visualization in Python, helping users quickly explore COVID-19 data for different countries and regions.

## Key Features:

Load and clean COVID-19 datasets for analysis

Visualize trends in total cases and deaths over time

Compare COVID-19 data across multiple countries

Generate summary statistics and plots for insights

Interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (if included)

## Purpose / Goal:
